This folder contains the code to initialize the DB. 

Make sure that the initDB file has the username, password and port for your postgres
instalation stored in the values MYUSER, MYPWRD and MYPORT. (Any postgres instalation containing the database "SE4G" and is reachable from 
localhost.)

Then run the initDB file and this should set up your database correctly.
